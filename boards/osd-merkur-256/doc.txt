 * @brief       Support for the Merkurboard 256rfr2 

# Overview
The Merkurboard is a development of the OSDomotics Group
We started the project by porting the Merkurboard from Contiki-OS to RIOT
[ATmega256rfr2](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-8393-MCU_Wireless-ATmega256RFR2-ATmega128RFR2-ATmega64RFR2_Datasheet.pdf)
MCU as common feature.

It is Arduino like and features USB programming. The Bootloader is a fork of the Arduino Bootloader with added functionality.

The Merkurboard is design as a core board featuring a MCU, RF-transceiver an adjustable power supply between 1.8V to 3.3V  and a LED. All unused Pins
are connected to pin headers.

The MCU comes with a 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4 radio that is compatible with the
Atmel AT86RF23x line of transceivers with the only difference being that it is
not being accessed over an SPI bus, but instead the radio registers are directly
mapped into memory.

# Flashing RIOT
Flashing RIOT on the Merkurboard is quite straight forward, just connect your Merkurobard using the USB Serial Converter with 3V3 
to your host computer and type:

`make flash BOARD=osd-merkur-256`
